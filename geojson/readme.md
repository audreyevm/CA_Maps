  - From FWS website: "Digital ecosystem information portraying the location and boundaries of the ecosystems. The Service originally chose the USGS Hydrologic Unit Map as the foundation for ecosystem unit boundaries, some of the region boundaries have been moved to the closest county boundary. The current unit boundaries reflect this combination."

- CA Forests, classified by FAO ecological zones
  - https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/4fb69e76e4b03ad19d64b507
  - From Summary: "This data set shows forests of North America, classified according to FAO ecological zones (EZ).  The data set was created by modifying the Ecological Regions of North America (ecoregions) data included in the North American Atlas. Ecoregion classifications were converted to the FAO EZ classes, based on the Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) 2010,  and minor adjustments were made to polygon geometry.  In addition, data were added for Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and additional lakes were imported. The FAO ecological zones are based on a combination of climate (temperature and precipitation) and potential vegetation classifications.  They are broad areas of relatively homogeneous vegetation, with similar physical characteristics. Some ecological zones (i.e. temperate steppe) contain limited or no forest; areas are considered forested when they have a 10 percent minimum crown cover.  Orchards and other fruit tree plantations used for agricultural production are not classified as forest."
